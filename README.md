# Who is In 

[live](https://who-is-in.herokuapp.com/)

RoR app aimed at aiding the organization of repeated events. In particular it aims to help with planning and communication for sporting events.

- Users can create teams (thereby becoming captain of that team)
- They can invite other users to join their team
- Each team has its own page where teammates can communicate with messages
- Captains can upload a picture/pdf of the schedule for teammates to view
- Captains can also enter in details of upcoming events such as the venue and time
- Teammates can register as not attending upcoming events -- this gives everyone an idea of how many people to expect to show up

This app was created through test driven development using Cucumber and RSpec. For more details on its features, check out the features file!
